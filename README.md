# todo-list
<pre>
I have made this project from a tutorial and I added some new features to it

The tutorial:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf3CEsEwMQ&t=3901s

Added features:
    -fixed a bug that in the original you can add empty boxes to your Todo list
     now title required
    
    -the biggest changes are:
        -you can now select a date from a calendar before creating a todo and this todo is going to be
        created in a div with a title of the date you choosed.

        -the calendar is going to recommend you the current date automatically

        -the original project saved the todos but it did not save the filters for it
        so after you refreshed the page all your marked todos become unmarked
        now it saves it as well

        -it saves the divs it creates for holding todos with the same date

        -when you delete a todo and no more todo is left on one date block
        the date block is gonna be deleted ass well

        -when it creates a new date block for you, it automatically put it in order
        for you, so it is better organized

        -it also does that after you refreshed the page and loaded the todos



known Bug: when you add a new todo to it the filters should be on "All" couse otherwise it not
works properly, but it is not a priority of mine to fix it right now, maybe later.

maybe i am gonna ad some aditional feture
